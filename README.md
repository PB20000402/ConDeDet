# ConDeDet: Vulnerability Detection via Contrastive Learning with Data and Control Dependency Comments

## Introduction

**ConDeDet** is a cutting-edge method for automatic software vulnerability detection using **contrastive learning**. The core innovation lies in the use of **data and control dependency comments** to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to capture deep semantic information in the code. By enriching code representations with dependency annotations, ConDeDet outperforms existing deep learning and pre-trained model-based approaches on standard benchmarks like Devign and Reveal.

## Key Features

- **Dependency Annotations:** Adds data and control dependency comments to code, improving vulnerability detection.
- **Contrastive Learning:** Leverages contrastive learning to better capture the relationship between annotated and non-annotated code snippets.
- **Pre-trained Model Integration:** Works with popular pre-trained models like CodeBERT and Code LLaMA, demonstrating strong generalization across different architectures.
